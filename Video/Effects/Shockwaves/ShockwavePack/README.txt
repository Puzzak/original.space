--==: READ BEFORE USING :==---

NOTICE: YOU CAN ADD THESE SHOCKWAVES TO ANY PROJECT IN ANY EDITER. THIS 'HOW TO' GUIDE IS FOR AFTER EFFECTS BUT IT WILL WORK IN PRETTY MUCH ANY GOOD EDITER IF YOU KNOW HOW TO USE IT.


HOW TO ADD COLOR TO SHOCKWAVES:

Add the Effect "Hue & Saturation". Checkmark "Colorize" on and set the saturation up to 100. Changing the hue will effect the color of the shockwave. Reducing the saturation will make the shockwave paler/lighter and 'brighter'.


HOW TO STACK MULTIPLE SHOCKWAVES:

The shockwaves are pre-matted for ease of use. To stack multiple shockwaves on top of each other (and be able to see the shockwaves underneath), select all the shockwaves and set their "Blending Mode" to "Lighten".


COOL TRICKS FOR A BETTER USE OF SHOCKWAVES:

Keyframe the shockwaves hue so it slowly changes during its on-screen life.
Keyframe a blur effect so it slowly blurs during its on-screen life.
Add a "Glow" effect to the shockwave that is brightest at the birth and fades out slowly.
Add "Turbulent Displace" on a 'firey' layer to give an illusion of heat.
Add a wiggle expression [ wiggle(3,4) is good ] to the Pos. value to give a shaking movement.
Add multiple of the same shockwave an set the size of one 20-50% bigger.
Add lens bloom and flare effects to give a more realistic effect.
Add smoke/drifting dust or an atmosphere in the back to also add a realistic effect.
This can also be made by tweaking settings with a "Particle World II" effect.

Experiment round an you can make a MASSIVE variety of cool effects.


HOW TO RENDER:

To render your video, go to the composition you want and press 'CTRL+M' or go to 'Composition > Add to Render Queue' in the top bar. then, once added to the
Render Queue, Go down to the button that says "[your composition name].avi" and click it. Save your file wherever you want (With any name). Once done, Hit RENDER! Make sure to save your After Effects Project (CTRL+S) so that you keep your changes!
